Blocky! is a revolutionary new way to manage your content and add additional sections to your page content with no theme editing required!

== Description ==
Have ever encountered the need to add new sections to your page content without needing to add divs to your content, editing your theme files or using a widget? Are you a WordPress novice and have no idea what that previous sentance means? Fear no longer - Blocky! is here. 

Blocky! allows you to add a new section to the content of your posts and pages without needing to know any web coding. Simply click on the "Add New Content Section" button and get typing. Blocky! brings in a new WYSIWYG editor, allowing you to add more content the same way you would with your main post content. Want to change the layout of your additional content sections? Simply add classes to your content section and use your stylesheet to do the rest. Would you rather not wrap your content in a `div`? Simply edit it in the settings page. Only want to use Blocky! on select post types? You can choose which post types to enable Blocky! from the settings page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why can't I use the plain text editor or media uploader? =
Unfortunately the way the WYSIWYG editor is activated for new sections it doesn't support the plain text editor or media uploader for new sections. However if you save your post any content sections that had been created will include both the media uploader and plain text editor.

= Why don't you just use a widget? =
I have found that users find it easier if all the content for a page or post is confined to the editor for that page or post, not split across multiple pages.

= Why aren't my Blocky! content sections saved in the revisions? =
Blocky! content sections are saved as post meta, which is different to post content. Only the title and content are saved in revisions. This is something I will look to explore in future versions.
